# NuexExchangeApiTest
Test for Nuex Exchange 

Test project to get Nuex Exchange API working - https://www.nuex.com/support/apidocs

Unauthenticated methods work correctly, but authenticaed do not

HMAC256 signature in c# is working, tested against the example on the API page

Curl based equivalent works, tested against the same API key/secret that fails from c#
